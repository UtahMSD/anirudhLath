1. 	I am sending icmp signals to my partner.

2. 	Source address: 192.168.50.208
	Destination address: 192.68.50.159

3. 	Yes, every byte of hex is resulting in a character from the ASCII table. There were some	characters that weren't on the ASCII table.

4. 	Partner and Personal ping time was 10ms on average.
	Ping to google was 30ms on average.
	Ping to louvre.fe was 150ms on average.
	They are directly correlated to the distance between the host and the target. The higher the ping the greater the distance.

5. 	Yes, there were many different things under tcp.port==80 filter. Mostly it was HTTP data, but I also saw Application Data, TLSv1.2 data etc. It was all encrypted so cannot really make sense of what the data was saying.

6. 	Curl command produced data which was not exactly fully encrypted. I was able to see some data such as the domain name of the curl target.

7. 	All the data is encrypted for public safety. So everything on wireshark appears encrypted. There could be different levels of encryption such as browser or router.
